IPython Notebook for NBI

1) A folder called FITS with 5 raw images taken with a UChicago CCD exposed to an Iron-55 source. I can sync more if you want to some commonly accessible server since each one is ~17MB

2) A file DAMIC-Fe55.ipynb which is a Juypter notebook (http://jupyter.org) containing Python code I wrote (that you can run out of the box if you have the astropy package) which explains basic analysis steps. We normally use ROOT and have a whole analysis pipeline but I wrote something quick and dirty which is hopefully a lot more useful. It walks through opening a file all the way through constructing the energy spectrum after clustering and finding the calibration constant. 

3) The file DAMIC-Fe55.pdf is just the notebook in formatted output.
